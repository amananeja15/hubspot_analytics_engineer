/*
Question: Q3B â€“ Maximum Possible Stay for Listings with Both Lockbox & First Aid Kit
Purpose: Compute the longest possible stay (same logic as Q3A) but only for listings that have BOTH 'lockbox' and 'first aid kit' amenities.
Method: Filter listings to those with both amenities using the exploded amenities model, then run the same max-stay calculation.
Source: int_amenities_exploded + stg_calendar
Window: July 12th 2021 to July 11th 2022
Notes: Expected to show a significantly shorter maximum stay vs Q3A.
